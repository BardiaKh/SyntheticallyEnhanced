## Model Training

We used [Mediffusion](https://github.com/BardiaKh/Mediffusion) for training our diffusion model. Model configs are present in the `mediffusion_config.yaml` file. Additionally, a sample python file for training the model is provided.

## Image Generation

Sample generation script is located at `generation.py`.
